// The ever changing ankara: you a fashion designer known for your unique and vibrant
// Ankara designs.Recently,you,ve discovered that some of your fabric patterns change
// their designs based on the temperature and mood of the weather.You want to create
// a softwae application that can predict the changes in the fabric design given the mood  
// and the temperature data.Think about the classes you will need to model the changing 
// Ankara and how to predict  the changes.
// How can I go about this

// This class represents the Ankara fabric and its properties. It has the following attributes:

// design: the current design of the fabric
// temperature: the current temperature of the environment
// mood: the current mood of the environment
// It also has the following methods:

// changeDesign(): this method changes the design of the fabric based on the temperature and mood data.
// Temperature Class
// This class represents the temperature data and its properties. It has the following attributes:

// value: the current temperature value
// It also has the following methods:

// getValue(): this method returns the current temperature value.
// Mood Class
// This class represents the mood data and its properties. It has the following attributes:

// value: the current mood value
// It also has the following methods:

// getValue(): this method returns the current mood value.
// With these classes defined, I can now create the algorithm to predict the changes in the Ankara fabric design. The algorithm will use the following steps:

// Get the current temperature and mood data.
// Create a new instance of the Fabric class with the current design, temperature, and mood data.
// Call the changeDesign() method of the Fabric instance to predict the new design of the fabric.
// Display the new design of the fabric to the user.
// Here is an example code snippet that implements the algorithm:

// Define the classes
class Fabric {
  constructor(design, temperature, mood) {
    this.design = design;
    this.temperature = temperature;
    this.mood = mood;
  }

  changeDesign() {
    // Algorithm to predict the new design of the fabric based on temperature and mood data
    // ...
    return newDesign;
  }
}

class Temperature {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}

class Mood {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}

// Implement the algorithm
const currentTemperature = new Temperature(25);
const currentMood = new Mood('happy');
const currentDesign = 'design1';

const fabric = new Fabric(currentDesign, currentTemperature, currentMood);
const newDesign = fabric.changeDesign();

console.log(`New design: ${newDesign}`);
